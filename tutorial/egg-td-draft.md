# Egg TD draft for tutorial
Obstructive tutorials suck.

For an unobstructive one, make sure the pop-up notification (explaining what is and how to use the new item that the player found) is shown without pausing the game and in a place where it doesn't obstruct the playing field and can easily be closed.

The message could be something like: (> means what action was performed by the player)

`> grab helmet
Helmet: this is a relic from the age of Humans, and has lost most of it's power to the passage of Time. Perhaps you can breathe a new life into it by **fusing** some of our more powerful eggs with it?`

`> fuse eggs`
 `Ah, yes! The ancient art of **fusing**! With this, we can show those pesky invaders that we mean business! `
